## Notice

Project Gy is (probably) releasing it's last major version based on Codeigniter. The next version will be based on Lavarus and focused on social function. Currently only bug fixes for version 1.0 is planned.

## What is 'Project Gy'?
Project Gy (pronounce as _'Project Gee-Wai'_), a lyric-centered web-log based on PHP and MySQL, created by
[Blueset Studio](http://1a23.com) with [iBe](http://ilove.1a23.com). (Actually, it's just me.)

This project is inspired by my daily updates with lyrics on sites like Facebook and Twitter.
I was then thinking about creating a blog program that focus on lyric posting, and this whole thing came to my mind.

Through Project Gy, people can share their thoughts and feelings through existing lyrics,
and share them with all over the world (just people who can see it *=_=*) by simply type in the lyric and
some related information.

_\* By lyrics, here I means lyrics as in the songs._
