Project Lyricova (歌语计划)
=========================

Project Lyricova is a free and open source blogging tool focused on lyrics.

Project Lyricova is currently under the progress of a complete rewrite. The new program will consist of 2 parts: a jukebox + music library manager and a lyrics blog. The new tech stack is planned to be TypeScript + Node.js + MySQL + Express.js + React.

For the current version of Project Lyricova released in 2015, see the `v1` branch.

## Project structure
* `jukebox`: Music library manager and public jukebox.
* `lyricova`: Lyrics blog (similar to version 1).
