## What is 'Project Gy'?
Project Gy, a lyric-centered web-log based on PHP and MySQL. Created by [Blueset Studio](http://1a23.com) with [iBe](http://ilove.1a23.com). (Actually, it's just me.)

This project is built with help of [CodeIgniter](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/), [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) and [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)

This project is inspired by my daily updates with lyrics on sites like Facebook and Twitter. I was then thinking about creating a blog program that focus on lyric posting, and this whole thing came to my mind. 

Through Project Gy, people can share their thoughts and feelings through existing lyrics, and share them with all over the world (just people who can see it *=_=*) by simply type in the lyric and some related information.
